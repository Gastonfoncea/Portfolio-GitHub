Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.
=====================================================================================================================================


## ONLY RM Mobile App

I created from scratch an application to save gym exercises and their weights. From design to development, it is currently in testing phase in TestFlight.
It's my first app so it was a big challenge, at this moment I'm working on the ORM 2.0 version.

## Mangos - Expenses Tracker

I created this application from scratch to control the monthly expenses, it is still in development stage, where the idea is to add firebase to be able to log in.
